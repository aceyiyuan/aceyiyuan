### Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m currently working on projects that advance my programming skills.

🌱 I’m currently learning React and other fun coding-related stuff.

👨🏻‍💻 Most of my projects from last year were written in Python.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that use the Django framework. Send me a message if you need a hand.

💬 Ask me about machine learning, data collection, processing, and visualization. I also have knowledge in the healthcare field.

👾 Fun fact: Coding for enjoyment may help programmers weather changes in the IT industry and remain content in their work.

📫 How to reach me: You can email me at org.sugar@gmail.com.
